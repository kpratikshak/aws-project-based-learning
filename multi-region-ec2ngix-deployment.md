🌍 Terraform Multi-Region EC2 + Nginx Deployment
🧠 Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to launch two AWS EC2 instances in two different regions (for example: Mumbai and N. Virginia) using a single Terraform file. Each EC2 instance will automatically have Nginx installed and started, all set up from your AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance using Terraform 🚀

⚙️ Tech Stack Used
Tool	Purpose
☁️ AWS EC2	For creating cloud instances
🏗️ Terraform	Infrastructure automation tool
💻 AWS CLI	For authentication and credentials setup
🐧 Ubuntu	Used as the base instance to run Terraform commands
🧩 Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have:

✅ AWS EC2 Ubuntu instance to work on

⚙️ Terraform installed

sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install unzip -y
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/1.6.6/terraform_1.6.6_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_1.6.6_linux_amd64.zip
sudo mv terraform /usr/local/bin/
terraform -version
🔑 AWS CLI configured

aws configure
Enter:

AWS Access Key ID
AWS Secret Access Key
Default region (e.g., ap-south-1)
Output format: json
🧾 IAM User with EC2 and VPC permissions

🪜 Steps to Perform
1️⃣ Create Project Directory
mkdir terraform-nginx-multi-region
cd terraform-nginx-multi-region
2️⃣ Create Terraform Configuration File
Create a file named main.tf and paste the following:

provider "aws" {
  region = "ap-south-1"
}

provider "aws" {
  alias  = "us"
  region = "us-east-1"
}

# Security Group allowing SSH & HTTP
resource "aws_security_group" "nginx_sg" {
  name        = "nginx-sg"
  description = "Allow SSH and HTTP inbound traffic"

  ingress {
    from_port   = 22
    to_port     = 22
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  ingress {
    from_port   = 80
    to_port     = 80
    protocol    = "tcp"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }

  egress {
    from_port   = 0
    to_port     = 0
    protocol    = "-1"
    cidr_blocks = ["0.0.0.0/0"]
  }
}

# EC2 Instance in India Region
resource "aws_instance" "india_ec2" {
  ami           = "ami-0dee22c13ea7a9a67"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.nginx_sg.name]
  tags = {
    Name = "India-Nginx"
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt update -y",
      "sudo apt install nginx -y",
      "sudo systemctl enable nginx",
      "sudo systemctl start nginx"
    ]
  }

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
}

# EC2 Instance in US Region
resource "aws_instance" "us_ec2" {
  provider      = aws.us
  ami           = "ami-0866a3c8686eaeeba"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
  security_groups = [aws_security_group.nginx_sg.name]
  tags = {
    Name = "US-Nginx"
  }

  provisioner "remote-exec" {
    inline = [
      "sudo apt update -y",
      "sudo apt install nginx -y",
      "sudo systemctl enable nginx",
      "sudo systemctl start nginx"
    ]
  }

  connection {
    type        = "ssh"
    user        = "ubuntu"
    private_key = file("~/.ssh/id_rsa")
    host        = self.public_ip
  }
}
3️⃣ Initialize Terraform
terraform init
4️⃣ Validate Terraform File
terraform validate
5️⃣ Plan the Infrastructure
terraform plan
6️⃣ Deploy the Infrastructure
terraform apply -auto-approve
Terraform will: ✅ Launch EC2 instance in ap-south-1 (India) ✅ Launch EC2 instance in us-east-1 (US) ✅ Install Nginx automatically on both

🔍 Verification
Go to AWS EC2 Console in both regions

Check that both EC2 instances are running

Copy the Public IP of each instance

Open them in your browser:

http://<PUBLIC-IP>
You should see the Nginx default welcome page 🎉

🧹 Cleanup
When done, destroy all resources to avoid extra AWS charges 💰

terraform destroy -auto-approve
🧾 Summary
Action	Description
🌍 Deployed 2 EC2 Instances	One in India (ap-south-1) and one in US (us-east-1)
🧰 Used Terraform	Automated multi-region infrastructure setup
🌐 Installed Nginx	Verified with public IPs
🧹 Cleaned up	Safely removed all created resources
🎯 Final Outcome
You have successfully automated the creation of two EC2 instances in different AWS regions, each pre-configured with Nginx using Terraform 🏗️✨

Your infrastructure is now multi-region, reproducible, and easily destroyable — just like a true DevOps Engineer! 😎
